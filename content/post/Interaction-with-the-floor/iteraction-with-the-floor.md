Small area of white in a pool of darkness.

With patterns yet to be discovered.

Small darker area in the pool of darkness.

Is what keeps it so traumatized.

None of the lane waits for a change to come.

Only passerbys.

That will follow that door;

sit in a small blue area

with feet on the whole floor.

But most often likely not where you'd expect.
