I own myself.

No one but me owns me.

For any purpose they are to fulfill

or gain some pride.

<br/>
<br/>

I find myself,

I a caged situation

Where I loose myself in wonders

of what I could be and hide

<br/>
<br/>

I wonder myself,

In being unloved and unnoticed.

For I then have no leftovers

Or someone I owe.

<br/>
<br/>

I think myself,

In a situation where all are disappointed

By me trying so hard and failing to become

Someone I don't know.

<br/>
<br/>

I hurt myself,

For I think I can hurt others,

And the possible and horrible thing I may do

When I go insane.

<br/>
<br/>

I distract myself,

As I think or maybe overthink about

Everything in the people's reality

And I'm not just so

In the right lane.

<br/>
<br/>

I make believe myself,

I exist like a creature that has been created

Not by want,

Or love

But a medium to one's

Dreams come true.

<br/>
<br/>

I find myself,

Asking if I go away, the feeling

of onus would ever go and

I wound be stuck in this coup.
