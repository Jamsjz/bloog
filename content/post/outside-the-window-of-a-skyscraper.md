Outside the window of a skyscraper,

I see,

A tall crane pointing at an even taller tower,

A sleek building slightly in the 'lonely'-hood,

A tower radiating everywhere scaring birds.

A big gray patch in the pale blue,

leaving a mark of possible destructions,

Seems near when living in eternity's advancement.

But yet to see tomorrow.

People!

I have a resentment

No talk is left, only signals to convey

As there's also a limit to that everyday.
