Bless me this night with your playful kiss.

You are what's within and what I missed.

You know I longed to see those seductive lips.

With glaciers in, those eyes a heavenly bliss.

<br>
<br>

It's cold, but why am I indifferent?

You call me in my dreams, those light so faint.

A bouquet of orchids, with no bad traits.

I wonder where it went, to the sea or a saint.

<br>
<br>

This fabric with the touch of your love.

The utter freshness of the headless cloves.

Don't make me sob, don't make me cry.

Wish ain't to lose you, again this night.
