The sound of war amuses me.

The sound of arguments, and

Instruments amuses me.

The sound perfectly nurtured for decades

The sound giving a skillful tremelo

Held together by him,

That sound in a compact and managed way

amuses me.

<br/>
<br/>
He walks but nobody sees

Nobody is air, Nobody transparent like a glass

Norbert comes above

Abode! We giving it a shelter is a direction

We giving meaning to its existence-

our nature.

<br/>
<br/>

The nature is an emsemble

And god the maestro

We're barely a part of that group.

We're "replacing" the eternal maestro.

By our arrogance, ignorance, and ego.
