title: "Forgive me before I go"

I ask you to forgive me

Forgive me but ...

show me your resent,

your rage, before I go to the afterlife

---

Needless to be you that is fading with revenge

But make way for me to breathe.

That thing I said from deep, beneath,

in my heart- that's failing due to my keath,

my mystic forest and my fanatical woodland -

So someday, soon, I will leave

I ask you to forgive

---

I ask you to forgive me, also

Forgive before I go to the afterlife, then;

"You are happy.", I will say with the same belief.

Forgive me, Forgive.
