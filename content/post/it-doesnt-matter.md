Life a I know it is all in this world,

And I live here same as them all.

Life seen from behind is all that I know.

I get back there to see that show.

---

It's like a movie, happy I am there.

Same in this world, I too live here.

This is satisfaction or misery?

I feel happy, should I worry?

---

I'm researching on some expressing ways.

I'm in derision now that's all it pays.

All thoughts just come up with all regression.

Solidarity of desolation.

---

When see by them, to me, I'm hideous.

Love is strong have notorious.

This movie I have seen rejoices me.

But sorrow is a reality.

---

Here I am again fully in this world.

I still live here same as them all.

But now with no faces life is all lonely.

Shouldn't I know melancholy?

---

No! It doesn't matter.

At least to me.

But I couldn't have cared better or I would;

just see the world around me.
