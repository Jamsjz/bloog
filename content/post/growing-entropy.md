Cupid... Oh, love!

I start to hate the opposites

Later they show these love

and wait for romantic composites.

---

How you cupid, sing like a dove?

In merry, and in so much love.

Your arrow hurt me nevertheless.

My own desires and my own thoughts.

---

In pain you bring the courage to face.

My thought and my only love.

They say you hurt like a shadow in rain.

When all to do goes all in vain.

Opposite them or be the same.

You break them to find in their only pain.

---

Your words -- catalyst in a balanced act,

And so you love, and tale the fact

That only you were caught in act

But were never punished cause' of the deity's pact.

---

Till all energy is balanced that way.

And no weapon such would ever start the bay.

In an empty body, full of gas

and air and nothing, so would I say.
