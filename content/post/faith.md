I love someone, Actually many people.

I have a faith in them,

That when other anyone

Finds 'me'

They won't put me in shame.

<br>
<br>

I am everyone and everyone is me.

It's just that everybody sees what I cannot see.

So when everyone concieves, I believe.

But that someone, nobody can see.

<br>
<br>

We all love someone who doesn't exist in the present

We all have a faith that when we ourselves

become that "someone" of others,

we will get a glance of our "someone".

<br>
<br>

This is the tragedy of this cycle.

But, also the beauty of life in it's simplicity.

It is the beauty of faith.

Faith, that gives a meaning to life.

Faith, that gives us hope in all the ways,

is always

inhabiting in us.
