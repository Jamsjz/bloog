They left down the way far in the middle of nowhere.

Until they became destined to find it.

If there was something that could have handled it,

If there was was something that could have held it,

Then the light bringer would be so surprised.

He wouldn't get any souls to punish.

He wouldn't get any jobs to torture.

He wouldn't look up on humanity saying,

"Oh! What a civilization!

Play me on everything!

Blame me for everything!"

<br>
<br>

But,

When the light would come again,

From the wonder years,

When the soul is about to leave the body

When the body itself is leaving the soul.

Then,

The years of enlightenment

The years of struggle

The years of earning

Also,

The years of yearning

The years of envy

The years of greed

Are vanishing away.

And is upbringing a new prosperous and peaceful 'life' ahead

Or a literal hell.

<br>
<br>

Those wonder years are still to be faced.

Those years, even effaced,

Would never go in vain

Because,

One will be rewarded in heaven

or 'rewarded' in hell.
