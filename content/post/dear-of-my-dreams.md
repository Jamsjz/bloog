O' My dear of my dreams,

I've been captivated, by the brim

I stand for you, all of it fill

Oh! It's a dream, and so does it seem.

---

O' The might of heroland

I feel the respect of, my demand

is crushed but wakes ... pretends,

your image in wonderland.

---

O' my wishes of eternity

I'm pain of, A floating ship sinking

deep in water, divinity

Sleeping but wakes ... pretends.
