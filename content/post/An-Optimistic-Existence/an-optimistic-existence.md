title: An Optimistic Existence

Why don't you like, the feeling that you'll die.

Oh yes, it is the truth.

Every little turn is a risk bearing a lie.

So mind your tone that goes through your tooth.

<br/>
<br/>

Every step you take is a step towards death.

That is why you will ever not fail.

What you can, you should earn all wealth.

And may you make an everlasting trail.

<br/>
<br/>

You may say if we're all going to die...

Why should we care about this world?

Why should we keep on bearing that lie?

Why should we care of the wonderful world?

<br/>
<br/>

The thing is that, you want to be happy.

You want to live good, together in peace.

You want your name go on eternally.

You want a life with someone you can kiss.

<br/>
<br/>

So do not hesitate when you have a say,

When you have a heart if what you want to do,

When only you, only you have a way,

And when all knowing spirit is possessing you.
